# PySAL-ArcGIS-Toolbox
Infrastructure designed to enhance the usability of 
innovative spatial econometric methods within the
Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL). 
The integration framework leverages the user interface 
and data management capabilities
provided in ArcGIS making analytical techniques
developed in PySAL more accessible to the general GIS User.
